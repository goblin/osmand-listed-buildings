DESCRIPTION
  This repo contains an .obf map for use with OsmAnd which contains
  all Grade I and Grade II* listed buildings in England. Handy for people
  taking part in Wiki Loves Monuments.

  OsmAnd is a FOSS offline map viewer for Android:

   http://osmand.net/
  
  You can get OsmAnd from F-Droid market and download loads of OSM maps for it.

USAGE
  Place the Listed_england.obf file in your osmand/ directory (together
  with other maps) of your mobile device. You should see listed buildings
  appear as orange circles when you zoom in to level 10 or more. Remember
  to reload the maps or restart your OsmAnd.

RECREATION
  If you want to regenerate the .obf file, follow these steps:

  1. Download the Excel spreadsheet with the list from:

   http://www.owenboswarva.com/opendata/Listed_Buildings_England.zip

  2. Export sheet 1 and sheet 2 (Grade I and Grade II) as CSV with
     semicolon (;) delimiters

  3. Merge the two CSVs into one file

  4. Run my script:

   $ ./csv2osm.pl < listed_england.csv > listed_england.osm

  5. Get OsmAndMapCreator from:

   http://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAndMapCreator-new-dev.zip

  6. Run it and go to Window/Settings. A window named 'Preferences' will
     appear. Last item in it, "Rendering types (xml config to extract osm
	 data) file path": enter the path to rendering_types.xml.

  7. Click File/Create .obf from osm file and choose the osm file generated
     in step 4

  8. The .obf should be created somewhere in ~/osmand/

SOURCES
  List of buildings comes from:

  I also used malenki's csv2osm.sh script to learn about the OSM format.
  You can get the original here:

LICENCE
  The csv2osm.pl script is free software; you can redistribute it and/or 
  modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.
 
  The listed_england.csv was adapted from data that is licensed under
  Open Government Licence.

  The .obf is derived work and is somewhere between the two licences.
